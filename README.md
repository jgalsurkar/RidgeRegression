# Ridge Regression from scratch

The goal of this project was to create an efficient pth-order polynomial Ridge Regression model. We will test it the model by predicting the miles per gallon a car will get using six features about that car.

# Data

The data is broken into training and testing sets. Each row in both “X” files contain six features for a single car (plus a 1 in the 7th dimension) and the same row in the corresponding “y” file contains the miles per gallon for that car.
